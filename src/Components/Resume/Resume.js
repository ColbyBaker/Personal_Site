            <h3>About Me</h3>
                <h4>Learning about how something works is one of my favorite things in life. Programming is an endless pool of things to learn about, and because of that, I enjoy it immensely. My programming journey has had many memorable moments in between my first hello world, my first web app, and my first viable product. I have loved it so far and I am excited to push myself even more to learn, grow, and become a better programmer, scholar, and leader.</h4>

                <h4>Mandarin Payroll Project - React.js - Python</h4>
                    <h5>The Mandarin Restaurant’s current payroll system is severely out of date. Another manager and I proactively decided to automate the process with information we had in our point of sale system: Aloha. Originally the project was solely Python, now it is a full stack application with a React.js frontend and Python backend. The system radically reduces errors made and time spent by managers calculating payroll. We have created a report application that is both powerful and intuitive while remaining scaleable for future implementation.

                <h4>Jamming - Spotify API - React.js</h4>
                    <h5>This project for Codecademy’s Full Stack Web Development Course works with the Spotify API to search their database for music. It also allows the user to add songs to a playlist and save that playlist to their Spotify library via implicit grant flow authorization. Working with implicit grant flow is amazing, there are so many possibilities and projects it allows.</h5>
